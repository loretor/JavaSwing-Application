# Software Engineering Project
The objective of this project was to apply in practice what we have learnt during lectures with the purpose of becoming familiar with software engineering practices and be able to address new software engineering issues in a rigorous way. 

⚠️Unfortunately the [Documentation](/Documentazione.pdf) of the project is written in Italian.
There are also some UML diagrams, like class diagram, state diagram...

The project consists of a Java application to simulate the process of booking soccer fields, tennis courts, and other facilities. All the graphics were created using Java Swing
